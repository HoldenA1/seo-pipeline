                        <p>This is such an awesome organization and I'm so proud to have it still going strong here in Oakland after all these years. I've met so many special people through RPSC. Ok full disclosure I met my wife at RPSC! Art, craft, community, and the chance to find true love? What more could you possibly want from your local art non profit?!?! It can be intimidating to enter into an art space but fear not RPSC is for everyone! So glad that this amazing org has stood the test of time. This place deserves all of your support.</p>

                        <p>I knew Ara Jo.
    A shining star. She curated a show Adam and I did at Rock Paper Scissors, right before I moved abroad.
    Moved back, living now in Oakland and was happy to see RPS still up and running. Covid and all. These are good peopleâ€¦ keep it up</p>
