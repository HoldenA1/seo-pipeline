                        <p>This is one of San Francisco best underrated places. The prices are amazingly pocket friendly, and the food was insanely Delicious.
We had ordered dumplings, chicken, fried rice soup, dumplings, and pancakes. I love the fried rice. It was so flavourful and very comforting. The dumplings were great to, and the pancakes were loaded with meat. Definitely, this is a place which I will visit many more times in the future.</p>

                        <p>Came the other night with a few friends! It’s a tiny restaurant with 5-6 tables. Can get stuffy when packed especially with the kitchen just a couple feet away and one window for ventilation.

Food was decent, we ordered Shanghai soup dumplings, pan fried Shanghai dumplings, napa cabbage boiled dumplings, salt&pepper chicken wings, fried chive dumplings, spicy wontons and noodles. The dough was slightly too thick for all dumplings but you can tell it’s handmade! Chicken wings were crispy but lack flavor depth. Noodles had good chewiness, sauce was a tad oily. Chilli wantons were good!

I wanted so badly for it to be good because of the positive reviews. Maybe we went on an off-night but we weren’t impressed by the food? But we’re still willing to go back again if we’re in the area. Give it a try!! Was about $27-30 per pax from the food+tip.</p>

                        <p>This felt very special. Like we stumbled into a well kept Sunset secret. Where kids who grew up in San Francisco grew up eating here, where they learned to use chopsticks, where families came after church, or to celebrate a win. These are the no frills incredible eats that we personally love. It’s a hole in the wall, family owned and operated, leave your judgements at the door and leave so full and so happy.

Adding this one to our repeat spots.

Green beans were easily the best of our lives. Thank you.</p>

                        <p>I was craving for some dumplings and tofu before I had back to Texas from a business trip. It was a wonderful treat, delicious! I had Pork Dumpling with Green Chives- it melts in your mouth and the flavor was balance perfect! The 2nd dish was Salt Pepper Tofu- it crispy outside and soft inside with lots of seasoning and just wow! This is the place to go to if you want a traditional dumplings and salt and pepper, tofu! Would I come back you dam right I’ll be back on my next business trip!</p>
