                        <p>Great service! Lovely bartender, very chill and friendly. I don’t remember what I got but they were very yummy! I also tried a lychee drink, it was pretty good as well. Atmosphere was lively, everyone’s in their own world. Will definitely come back again to try more drinks.</p>

                        <p>I probably drink about 5 drinks a year, and I decided I would drink a Spiced Cider at Jukebar for my last one of the year on New Year’s Eve.  It was served in an adorable vintage coffee mug on a saucer with a cinnamon stick. Tasted like a warm friendly hug. I was inspired by the adorable cup and welcoming neighborhood atmosphere, so I decided to document my experience at the bar while I was waiting to attend a NYE party at Elsewhere that evening.

Due to some life-changing events, I was traveling solo to NYC from Charleston,SC. From the moment I sat down at the bar, I felt very welcome and at ease. I was served by the lovely Siobhan (Shiv for short) and got to know Connor as well. I noticed both had very Irish names and was entertained by their personalities. Being there felt much like going to a friend’s house. When I left the bar to go to my event, I left behind my favorite ink pen. I wasn’t having as much fun at the event as I hoped I would have (clubs aren’t great to go alone to lol), so I left early and noticed my pen was missing. I went back to Jukebar right after midnight, and much to my delight,  they had my favorite pen behind the bar.

I’m so happy they helped me find it again because without it, I wouldn’t have gotten to sketch the rest of my trip the way I wanted to. Thank you for a great experience and for helping a lonely traveler feel welcome in a new place. Truly such a great way to end 2024 and begin 2025. Wish you all the best!</p>

                        <p>Our group visited this basement-level spot, a charmingly gritty bar that perfectly suits the neighborhood's vibe. The drinks were strong and well-made, and the regional beer selection is definitely recommended. The staff was welcoming and the overall atmosphere was ideal for a casual gathering.</p>
