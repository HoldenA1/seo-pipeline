                <p><p>The Black Rose, located at 160 State Street in the heart of Boston near historic Faneuil Hall and Quincy Market, is a quintessential traditional Irish pub that offers a genuine Irish hospitality experience. Established in 1976, this neighborhood tavern stands out as a beloved destination for locals and tourists looking to savor hearty Irish cuisine such as Guinness beef stew, bangers and mash, and New England classics like lobster rolls and clam chowder. The pub features expertly poured Guinness pints served by staff often speaking with authentic Irish brogues, maintaining the authenticity of the Irish pub atmosphere. Beyond its menu, The Black Rose is famed for its lively ambiance, hosting live music seven nights a week which brings an energetic yet comfortable setting for friends and visitors to gather. The recent addition of a custom handcrafted black rose wood sculpture at the entrance symbolizes the pub's deep Irish roots and longstanding Boston tradition. Its location is easily accessible via Boston’s Blue Line (Aquarium Station) and Orange Line (State Street Station), making it a convenient meetup spot. The Black Rose’s blend of hearty food, traditional ales, live entertainment, and warm, welcoming environment makes it an ideal venue for meeting up with friends, sharing stories, and enjoying a classic Irish night out in Boston.</p></p>

                        <p>Food was a little on the cold side but tasty. Gets busy but other options in the area if you cant get in.  Had the Irish sampler trio...and plenty in the trio for two people.  Live music but starts latter in the evening. Neat place.</p>

                        <p>So, I visited the restaurant on a Monday evening around 7:30 p.m. When I entered, a lady led me to my table. I sat down and waited for about 20-25 minutes. The service seemed to be passing by, but they didn’t even bother to ask if I needed anything. Frustrated, I started flashing my phone and putting it face down so that they could see it on the table.

After a few minutes, a young man approached my table. He introduced himself with his right hand on his pocket and asked if I needed help. I ordered my food, which arrived promptly. I finished my food and beer and was ready to order another beer and fries. However, the guy disappeared for about another 30 minutes.

When he reappeared, I ordered the second half of my order.

In summary, the service was terrible, but the ambiance was special. The live music was amazing, and the food was okay. I ordered fish and chips, an Irish beer, and fries. The fries were the only thing that was not good.

However, the service was horrible for me. Maybe I was alone, and they didn’t want to see me.

When the bill is high, they prioritize customers who are with a group. Most of the time, if you have company sitting at the table, they will give you more attention.

I decided to give the minimum tip to the guy and instead gave it to the musicians. They were the reason I stayed there for so long.</p>

                        <p>Fun, rowdy bar with live music. Squeezed into a seat at the bar. Very much the Irish pub vibes. Listened to a really good live musician hitting the contemporary and traditional songs. Would have liked to try some food, but was happy to try the Black Rose Ale. Friendly crowd.</p>

                        <p>It is loud!  But that’s Irish pub for you!  I went there on Saturday night.  The food was amazing. If you can’t make up your mind just get the sampler.  The live music started at 9pm and really got the crowd going.</p>
