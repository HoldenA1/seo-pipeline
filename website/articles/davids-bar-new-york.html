                        <p>listen, i don’t usually take the time to write reviews. if you’re reading this and contemplating a visit, just do it.

i doubt a more welcoming and down to earth spot exists. if you’re looking to meet some good people in new york, i guarantee you’ll walk out at least two friends richer.

fatefully stumbled upon david’s as i was heading to the subway station. pretty unassuming, yet inviting from the outside.

sitting at the bar alone has always been a bit daunting for me, but today i felt like i belonged as soon as i walked in. the bartender, daniel, immediately asked me what i like and whipped up a custom mango-peach-tequila concoction for me. it was smooth!

they had good old school hip hop playing on a tuesday evening. i chatted with some fellows at the bar for a while and it was real nice. i even got to try my first pickle back!

a regular, mike, put me on to coppelia’s as well—if you’re on the market for a good 24 hr diner.

anyway, long story short, do yourself a favor and stop by. no pretense, good prices, great company.</p>

                        <p>I love Dave's! The drinks, positive vibes/ atmosphere, great bartenders and owner is awesome and super chill. The prices and location are great, also plenty of parking. It reminds me of cheers everyone knows each other and also trivia night is so much fun. I always have so much fun, good music/TVs and great intellectual conversations. Peace and love :)</p>

                        <p>Overall rating: 4.9

This place is underrated. Love the low key, chill energy in LES. No frills, which is my middle name. The drinks are STRONG, in the best possible way. I didn’t experience any karaoke, but I think I was there too early in the night. Went around 8 on a Saturday.

Definitely want to go again if I’m looking for a nightcap or just a chill place in the area.</p>

                        <p>First round of drinks was $14, then second round of the SAME drinks became $20, there’s no prices on the menu and the bartender just charge whatever they want. Not cool, especially we were regulars and we got scammed. We always had a great time here but beware of the prices and ask for the price before you order your drinks.

Update: David is so cool. He saw the review and gave us 2 rounds of drinks on the house for the misunderstanding. The bartender that day wasn’t cool, but the owner and other bartenders def made up for it. Still my favorite bar!!! They have white claws now for $5, can’t beat that price.</p>

                        <p>I didn't intend to be at this beautiful bar, however it was where I was ment to be. A place where everyone is ment to feel comfortable. As a bartender myself I would hire Jaime in a minute. I would work for David without a second thought. It is so nice to feel welcome as an outsider. Please go here and give them all of your money. The prices you can't beat it. The vibes... out of the world. I would give a sixth star if I could. Thank you. Alaskans on me. Thank you again </p>
