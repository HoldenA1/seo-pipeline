                        <p>The only Irish thing about this place seems to be the name.
Was here when there were only a few small groups in the pub. Were right upfront at the bar but still had to wait a at least 30 minutes to order. Seemed like the bartender was too busy fixing up herself than serving costumers. Out of 3 drinks ordered we only received 2 and one of those 2 was wrong. When asked about this we only got the very unfriendly answer that ”well that is what you got now“.
The music is too loud for a pub and does not really fit (seems more fitting for a night club). Also there are weird breaks between every song like someone first manually has to choose the next song.
Cleanliness does not seem important at all. I will spare you on the details for the restrooms.
Cannot recommend. There are definitely better places in the area.</p>

                        <p>Great Irish ☘️ Bar in Back Bay with excellent, friendly service, strong pours and a nice variety of delicious pub food. The newly renovated space is long and narrow with high tops, booths and a second bar in the back (opened on busier evenings). A great place to watch the game or to celebrate a Red Sox win. Definitely recommend!</p>
