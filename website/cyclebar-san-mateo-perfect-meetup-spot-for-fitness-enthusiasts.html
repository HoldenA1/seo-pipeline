                        <p>I recently took a trial class at Cycle Bar San Mateo and never looked back. I canceled my big name gym membership and started taking the morning classes here. Not only are the instructors great (my favorite classes are Jordan’s, Jennifer’s and Ama’s), but I’m also saving money moving to Cycle Bar. High endurance, fun music, and strength training and stress reliever all in one!</p>

                        <p>Being on the older end of the spectrum as far as clientele goes, I wasn’t sure if cyclebar would be the place for me. I’ve been a member over a year and I can tell you that it’s the most fun I’ve had in any exercise class. All the instructors are great, they challenge you, but at the same time remind you to just try your best and not worry about “stats”.
    The playlists and their theme rides are a lot of fun. Whenever I’ve had a rough day, everything is forgotten after class.</p>

                        <p>I went for a class here with a friend a week ago and they won’t stop calling about a membership. I unsubscribed to their texts but they still keep calling me during work hours. Their sales people are very aggressive which makes me not want to go back again even for a single class.</p>

                        <p>I have been going to CycleBar for over 6 months. After I took my first ride, which is free, I was hooked. This was my first time taking a spin class and I was nervous. All the instructors and the owner made it so welcoming and not intimidating. I highly recommend checking the studio out!</p>
