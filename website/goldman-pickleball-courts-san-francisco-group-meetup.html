                        <p>Amazing country club quality facility with a welcoming staff. Itâ€™s hard to get a court between the tennis players, and Pickleballers, but the system does seem to work.  There is a small canteen, vending machines, but this morning the coffee machine is out of order!  It would be nice if City would contract with a food truck/coffee shop to improve the food and drink availability.  Overall, no complaints.</p>
