                        <p>Super friendly, attentive, and interactive crew. Views of SF Bay were stunning, highly recommended sunset sail time (with complementary 1st beverage!) A++ excursion for locals and visitors to Bay Area. No sailing experience required other than following instruction from your captain & crew (might let you help hoist the sail too).</p>

                        <p>Great tour company!
Totally worth it the afternoon sailing on the bay.
Amazing views of the city, Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz.
Their catamaran is huge and very stable. We are glad that we booked it. What a ride! The staff onboard is very friendly and will give you a ton of information about the SF bay and city during the tour.</p>

                        <p>No better exploration of adventure than being a part of the Adventure Cat sailing on the Pacific. From the moment we set sail, it was clear that this experience would be unforgettable. The staff were not only extremely caring and committed to safety, but also incredibly interactive with everyone on board. They took the time to engage with each passenger, ensuring that everyone felt included and comfortable.

The breathtaking views of the Pacific Ocean, coupled with the smooth sailing of the catamaran, made for a perfect day. We were treated to stunning panoramas of the coastline and the majestic beauty of the open sea. The crew’s knowledge of the area added an educational element to the trip, making it both fun and informative.

The Adventure Cat provided all the amenities needed for a comfortable journey, from cozy seating areas to refreshments. Whether you wanted to relax and take in the scenery or get involved with the sailing process, there was something for everyone.

Overall, the Adventure Cat sailing trip exceeded all expectations. It was a delightful mix of adventure, relaxation, and learning, thanks to the fantastic crew and the awe-inspiring natural beauty of the Pacific. I would highly recommend this experience to anyone looking for an unforgettable adventure on the water.</p>

                        <p>This is one the best things we did while visiting San Francisco! The cost was perfect for two of us. It was not a large group of people which we liked, and everyone was accommodating.

The staff was friendly and helpful. One of the crew even took our picture when we asked and later asked if we wanted one driving the boat. (We declined, but what a cool idea!)

Once you are on board, they have jackets if needed. It is very windy and chilly when you get out on the water, especially as you approach the bridge.

What I loved about this cruise, is that you just enjoyed it at your leisure. No one was talking about histories, or building, etc. I got all that information on a day excursion and it was great, but that is another review. Anyway, it was nice to go with my wife and just enjoy the scenery and taking pictures, and just overall spending the moment together.

We were able to get a drinks and snacks at the bar. You can spend time inside or outside of the boat. There is plenty of room to move about and the crew is excellent.

Then the view of the bridge! Breathtaking! It was amazing to be up that close and underneath. (See pics.) But there are also great views of Alcatraz and SF.

Personally this is a MUST see if you come to San Francisco!</p>
