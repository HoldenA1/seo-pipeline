                        <p>As a fan of Wanpo Tea Shop in Taiwan, I was thrilled to visit their Bay Area location. The shop itself is spotless and exudes positive vibes, and the service from the staff was top-notch. They patiently explained the beverage options, which I appreciated.

However, I can't help but feel a bit disappointed. The boba just didn't taste the same as what I remember from Taiwan. I ordered one milk tea with toppings and one fruit tea, but sadly, I couldn't finish either of them. The flavor didn't quite hit the mark for me. Additionally, I found the prices to be on the higher side.

I really wanted to love this place, but unfortunately, it didn't live up to my expectations from the Taiwan experience. It's a 3 stars from me, with hopes that they can work on perfecting their flavors to match the original taste!</p>

                        <p>I've been a regular here for several months, and I have to say this is hands-down one of the best, if not the best, boba shops in the Bay Area. I absolutely love the aesthetics and vibe of the shop, with a comfortable and aesthetically-pleasing environment.

The quality of tea, toppings, and service are all top-notch. My go-to drinks are the Alishan Oolong and Jasmine Lemon Green Tea, both of which are high-quality and always come with the right amount of sweetness and concentration of tea. I really like the pearls here too, as the consistency and sweetness are always on point. Finally, the service has always been consistently warm and welcoming, and I find myself coming back again and again for them.

Overall, Wanpo is a spot not to miss in Cupertino, and I look forward to trying more drinks in the future!</p>

                        <p>We visited Wanpo Tea Shop on a Saturday afternoon, and parking was convenient enough with spots relatively easy to find. Upon entering, we noticed the ordering process is self-service via a kiosk located on the left side, which made for a smooth and quick ordering experience.

We tried four drinks: Coconut Purple Rice Taro Milk, Wanpo Milk Tea, Guava Jinxuan Oolong, and Sugar Cane Oolong Tea. Unfortunately, they didn't serve crystal boba, so I opted for Aiyu Jelly as a substitute in my drink. While the toppings were fine, the drinks themselves left us wanting more. The flavors were quite muted, lacking the boldness or richness we expected from a specialty tea shop. Even the Wanpo Milk Tea, their signature drink, didn’t particularly stand out.

The shop had a nice vibe and the staff were friendly, but for a place specializing in tea, the taste fell short of our expectations. While it wasn’t bad, it was just average, and we’ve had better boba experiences elsewhere. If you’re in the area, it’s worth trying, but it may not become your go-to spot for bubble tea.</p>

                        <p>First time here. Surprised there are no lines. Ordering is done on a touchscreen and there are two screens available onsite. The most popular drink is the milk tea red bean. First sip and the tea flavor is strong!  Brings back memories of flavors during high tea time except there's whole red beans and some type of fruit jelly in the drink, not Boba pearls. I'm guessing it's because the tea is from black tea, hence the strong flavor. I'm not sure yet if I like the extra stuff with the tea.</p>
