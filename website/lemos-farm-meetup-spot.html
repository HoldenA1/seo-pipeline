                        <p>We had the best time at Lemos Farm! They have so many fun attractions for kids and some for adults! We arrived right when they opened and found parking near the front. My kids loved riding the ponies, going on the train ride, feeding the goats, mining for gems, and going down the bouncy slide. We stopped for a little treat break because we had to try the pumpkin cupcakes - they were delicious! We ended our trip with picking out some really cool pumpkins. This was such a fun and memorable day for our family. We canâ€™t wait to go back! ðŸ§¡</p>

                        <p>The farm was pretty full because we went on a weekend but me and my family still had a great time. We got to try goat yoga and it was a blast. The pumpkin pie ice cream was amazing! A girl named Sam scooped the ice cream for me and she was so sweet. I would definitely recommend Lemos Farm for a fun fall festivity.</p>

                        <p>Wow, Lemos Farm is a hidden gem! We spent the day in Half Moon Bay this weekend and decided to turn in here and it was so much fun. There was live music, cute pumpkin decorations everywhere, and so much to do. It sure is a popular spot on the weekends and I can understand why. This will become a new fall tradition!</p>

                        <p>The farm is very nice, it has many activities and cute photo spots, the workers do an excellent job. I visited on Saturday and there were so many people that it was difficult to enjoy the attractions, it was difficult to grab something to eat and sit down Sometimes difficult to walk due to the number of people., you have to take your time and be very patient since the number of people who come is larger than the place there.</p>

                        <p>Do not waste your time visiting during the pumpkin season weekend. The entire experience was a disasterâ€”completely unorganized and ridiculously overcrowded. We waited over an hour for both the train and hay rides, with staff who seemed clueless and lacked any sense of direction. The farm clearly has no control over the crowd size, and despite the overwhelming numbers, they kept selling tickets. Theyâ€™re obviously just in it for the money and couldnâ€™t care less about your experience.

They have two ticket sessionsâ€”9:30 AM to 2 PM and 12 PM to 5 PMâ€”but itâ€™s a complete joke. Even if you buy the morning session, you can stay as long as you want, and no one checks. So whatâ€™s the point of having these time slots? It just makes the afternoon unbearably crowded, turning the whole thing into a nightmare.

The kids' car drive was another mess. After a grueling 40-minute wait, my child finally got to the front, only to find that ride times are completely random. The group before us drove for about ten minutes while the worker wandered off, then he came back and said they had one minute leftâ€”but gave them four more minutes! Thereâ€™s no consistency or fairness, and itâ€™s beyond frustrating.

This place is a money-grab operation with zero regard for customer satisfaction. Iâ€™ve never had a worse experience at a farm or festival.</p>
