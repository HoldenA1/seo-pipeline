We got lucky and someone left so we just grabbed the spot. The cocktails were very unique. It’s one of the best bar I have been. They don’t have any food to serve on the side. It tells you how much confident they have for their cocktail. The environment is very chill. It’s definitely not quiet, but not loud enough that you cannot hear other people. They are also very professional. I would recommend here if you wanna try unique cocktails."

They do not take reservations - maybe for private events they do, but the place was big enough to accommodate walk-ins on weekday nights. They have outdoor seating as well as indoors - we chose the outdoor seating at the time cause we wanted some fresh air (beware though, it got pretty chilly later in the night but we were not offered a seat inside so that was the slight downside).\n\nService was good - the waiter was attentive and provided good recommendations, while also not too aggressively checking in with us - which helped us keep our conversations going.\n\nIn terms of drinks, we ordered two rounds of drinks, and the most recommended drink would be the Pornstar Martini (Reyka Vodka, passionfruit, vanilla, citrus, sparkline wine) - it was great presentation and super delicious - citrusy and sweet. The second recommendation would be the All Thai’d up (El Jolgorio Tepeztate, rum, lime leaf, coconut, tom yum, citrus, thai chili) - don\'t get scared off by the name, the tom yum taste is very slight, so it\'s a super unique and interesting drink that\'s very tasty. Last recommendation is the Golden Opportunity (Sherry, blanc vermouth, golden sesame, macadamia nut, cointreau, cacao) - this drink has a very interesting before, during, and after taste - very nutty finish, definitely recommend if you like sherry!\n\nDefinitely looking to come back again!"

    Food was decent, we ordered Shanghai soup dumplings, pan fried Shanghai dumplings, napa cabbage boiled dumplings, salt&pepper chicken wings, fried chive dumplings, spicy wontons and noodles. The dough was slightly too thick for all dumplings but you can tell it’s handmade! Chicken wings were crispy but lack flavor depth. Noodles had good chewiness, sauce was a tad oily. Chilli wantons were good!

    I wanted so badly for it to be good because of the positive reviews. Maybe we went on an off-night but we weren’t impressed by the food? But we’re still willing to go back again if we’re in the area. Give it a try!! Was about $27-30 per pax from the food+tip.""",

    The Adventure Cat provided all the amenities needed for a comfortable journey, from cozy seating areas to refreshments. Whether you wanted to relax and take in the scenery or get involved with the sailing process, there was something for everyone.

    Overall, the Adventure Cat sailing trip exceeded all expectations.

    The staff was friendly and helpful. One of the crew even took our picture when we asked and later asked if we wanted one driving the boat. (We declined, but what a cool idea!)

    Once you are on board, they have jackets if needed. It is very windy and chilly when you get out on the water, especially as you approach the bridge.

    What I loved about this cruise, is that you just enjoyed it at your leisure. No one was talking about histories, or building, etc. I got all that information on a day excursion and it was great, but that is another review. Anyway, it was nice to go with my wife and just enjoy the scenery and taking pictures, and just overall spending the moment together.

    We were able to get a drinks and snacks at the bar. You can spend time inside or outside of the boat. There is plenty of room to move about and the crew is excellent.

    Then the view of the bridge! Breathtaking! It was amazing to be up that close and underneath. (See pics.) But there are also great views of Alcatraz and SF.

Additionally, I found the prices to be on the higher side.

    We tried four drinks: Coconut Purple Rice Taro Milk, Wanpo Milk Tea, Guava Jinxuan Oolong, and Sugar Cane Oolong Tea. Unfortunately, they didn't serve crystal boba, so I opted for Aiyu Jelly as a substitute in my drink. While the toppings were fine, the drinks themselves left us wanting more. The flavors were quite muted, lacking the boldness or richness we expected from a specialty tea shop. Even the Wanpo Milk Tea, their signature drink, didn’t particularly stand out.

    The shop had a nice vibe and the staff were friendly, but for a place specializing in tea, the taste fell short of our expectations. While it wasn’t bad, it was just average, and we’ve had better boba experiences elsewhere. If you’re in the area, it’s worth trying, but it may not become your go-to spot for bubble tea.""",

We waited over an hour for both the train and hay rides, with staff who seemed clueless and lacked any sense of direction. The farm clearly has no control over the crowd size, and despite the overwhelming numbers, they kept selling tickets. They’re obviously just in it for the money and couldn’t care less about your experience.

    They have two ticket sessions—9:30 AM to 2 PM and 12 PM to 5 PM—but it’s a complete joke. Even if you buy the morning session, you can stay as long as you want, and no one checks. So what’s the point of having these time slots? It just makes the afternoon unbearably crowded, turning the whole thing into a nightmare.

    The kids' car drive was another mess. After a grueling 40-minute wait, my child finally got to the front, only to find that ride times are completely random. The group before us drove for about ten minutes while the worker wandered off, then he came back and said they had one minute left—but gave them four more minutes! There’s no consistency or fairness, and it’s beyond frustrating.

    This place is a money-grab operation with zero regard for customer satisfaction. I’ve never had a worse experience at a farm or festival.""",

    First thing I noticed is they’re very nice. Very welcoming. That sets the tone. Next thing I noticed is they have a fairly large rectangular grill which is better than the circles I usually see. And they are fast about changing the grill expeditiously as it gets gunked up with the sauces.

    It’s spacious and yet urban nice inside. Perhaps a little dark but different strokes for different folks. We were in the side room which was darker.

    About $40 for the all you can eat, which I would recommend. You get two appetizers and four meats at a time. Also can get a couple sides and/or veggies.

    Good selection of meats. And the meats are GOOD portion size. And good thickness. Excellent soup and sides. Specifically the tofu soup. Softener kinds of rice. All goodness.

    You will leave here full of you get the all you can eat.

    Parking lot is a little odd. Slotted, angled spaces; so you need to back out to the street to exit. But at least they have a posting lot at all! Better than street parking.""",
