                        <p>The facilities are decent, the saunas are nice and hot. The only thing that really sours the experience for me and takes away stars is the incredibly rude (for no reason) front desk staff. Upon entering they did not greet me or look me in the eye, just kept talking among themselves. And two other times I interacted with them during my visit, totally non-attentive and disengaged. It costs nothing to be at least courteous to patrons who are paying you hundreds of dollars.</p>

                        <p>Definitely an eastern European vibe. The male staff are not big fans of the coloreds. ðŸ˜‚. As soon as I walked in and took a shower, I heard "Staff-Guy-A" whisper to "Staff-Guy-B" to "watch him". Then for an hour, I sat in the hot tub and ignored the blue eyes piercing the side of my head. I think they wanted to make a point clear that this place is reserved solely for blue collar white guys that are trying to date chicks out of their tax bracket.

(My ex brought me so I took it like a champ instead of leaving immediately. In case anyone is wonderingwhy I would stay for an hour ðŸ˜‚.)</p>

                        <p>Went here yesterday for the first time. I've been to many bathhouses but this was the first time I've been to a coed bathhouse. Had the best deep massage from Davon. Enjoyed the Russian style saunas, and heated pools. And went around their cafe, TV lounge and patio. Overall, a great experience.</p>

                        <p>This was the most wonderful thermal spa experience for my wife and me. We enjoyed every second of our 3 hours here - it's just enough time to actually feel completely relaxed and unrushed. Only wish I'd that the plunge was a little larger. An amazing space!</p>

                        <p>Every time I try to go here it's closed ðŸ˜ž last time, it was a women's only night, so I was turned away (rudely). The woman at the front desk made me feel bad for not knowing it was women only that night, and implied I was trying to creep or something? It left a sour taste in my mouth.

Recently I was told they have specials on your birthday, so I went on mine only to discover they're not open on Tuesdays. I hear so many good things about this place, but I've never had a good experience myself.</p>
