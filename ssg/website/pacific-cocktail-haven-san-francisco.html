                        <p>I have heard of this place for a long time. They were so crowded on a weekend night and we couldn’t really find a seat. We got lucky and someone left so we just grabbed the spot. The cocktails were very unique. It’s one of the best bar I have been. They don’t have any food to serve on the side. It tells you how much confident they have for their cocktail. The environment is very chill. It’s definitely not quiet, but not loud enough that you cannot hear other people. They are also very professional. I would recommend here if you wanna try unique cocktails.</p>

                        <p>such a cute chill vibe here! visiting from out of town & had some of the best drinks here. Our host was super nice & wrote down a list of bars for a bar crawl on our way to a concert. Waitress was also super sweet & nice. 100% recommend stopping by.

The drinks were SO yummy. I got a virgin version of their Thai iced tea cocktail (forgot the name) & their espresso martini was also delicious. 10/10 overall.</p>

                        <p>This place recently became my favorite cocktail bar in SF. The drinks are creative, visually stunning, and delicious. All the staff members I’ve interacted with here are super friendly. On my second visit to PCH during a girls’ night out, Chelsea took care of my group, introduced herself after I said I recognized her from when I first came here during Halloweekend, and took the time to get to know us. My experience based on both visits here is 10/10. This place is popular for a reason, so you’ll definitely want to hit up this spot for your next night out!</p>

                        <p>Came here for drinks with some colleagues! It's honestly a great venue for friends gathering or work event. They do not take reservations - maybe for private events they do, but the place was big enough to accommodate walk-ins on weekday nights. They have outdoor seating as well as indoors - we chose the outdoor seating at the time cause we wanted some fresh air (beware though, it got pretty chilly later in the night but we were not offered a seat inside so that was the slight downside).

Service was good - the waiter was attentive and provided good recommendations, while also not too aggressively checking in with us - which helped us keep our conversations going.

In terms of drinks, we ordered two rounds of drinks, and the most recommended drink would be the Pornstar Martini (Reyka Vodka, passionfruit, vanilla, citrus, sparkline wine) - it was great presentation and super delicious - citrusy and sweet. The second recommendation would be the All Thai’d up (El Jolgorio Tepeztate, rum, lime leaf, coconut, tom yum, citrus, thai chili) - don't get scared off by the name, the tom yum taste is very slight, so it's a super unique and interesting drink that's very tasty. Last recommendation is the Golden Opportunity (Sherry, blanc vermouth, golden sesame, macadamia nut, cointreau, cacao) - this drink has a very interesting before, during, and after taste - very nutty finish, definitely recommend if you like sherry!

Definitely looking to come back again!</p>

                        <p>TLDR: you’re paying for the atmosphere mainly

The atmosphere is very nice as it is heavily decorated for Christmas, as well as having holiday themed drinks. But with a $10 cover and $20 drinks that are fairly small cocktails, you’re paying about $40 for one drink after tax and tip. That just doesn’t seem justified. On top of that, it gets very stuffy inside, circulation is not very good</p>
